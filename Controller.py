        This function is the lifeline of the whole pipeline. It does the essential task of integrating all
        other modules together, viz-a-viz., Input, Planner, Task, Farm, etc. to get the rover up and running.
        The function helps to get the next robot location through user input as a string and then run the
        Input module for parsing its meaning. Later, the input module allocates an encoded task to the Task
        module if the command was a valid command. The task module allocates the tasks to the path module
        sequentially and appends the found path to the Rover class instance. The Rover class then takes care
        of the job of walking the rover through every individual waypoint in sequence for every one second.
